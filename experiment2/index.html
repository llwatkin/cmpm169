					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						My goal for this experiment was to create a digital kaleidoscope of a fractal pattern.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Controls</b>
						<br>
						Mouse: move to the right to rotate the kaleidoscope to the right, and left to rotate it to the left<br>
						Sliders: play with the sliders to change qualities of the kaleidoscope<br>
						S: save canvas as a png<br>
						<br>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						I found a simple recursive tree algorithm and used it as the base pattern for the kaleidoscope.
						The canvas is divided up into a series of radial segments, from which these trees are drawn.
						Each tree is drawn recursively, sprouting from the center of a particular point on the canvas, and its 
						accompanying reflection is drawn, facing the opposite direction. Several of these radial trees
						are drawn in various points on the canvas. When the mouse moves, the angle by which each branch
						in each tree is rotated changes.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I worked by myself on this project. The experience went a lot smoother than I had expected, and 
						certainly smoother than the last experiment. I had a clear vision from the beginning and I feel 
						that I accomplished exactly what I set out to do. Of course, there were problems initially with 
						figuring out how to use pop and push to save and restore coordinate systems, so that made starting 
						out particularly frustrating. Once I was able to produce something that looked close to what I 
						envisioned, I got past that hurdle and spent the rest of my time experimenting almost completely 
						free of frustration.
