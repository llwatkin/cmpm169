					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						My aim with this experiment was to create interesting
						visual effects accompanied by audio, with can be
						modified with simple mouse controls. My goal was to
						create visual and audio effects that worked with and
						enhanced one another.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Controls:</b>
						<br>
						Left mouse button: hold and drag to modify the circles
						and their respective sound<br>
						Right mouse button: hold and drag to modify the squares
						and their respective sound<br>
						R: randomly generate a new seed<br>
						S: save canvas as a png
					</p>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						I render each shape one after the other on a 20x20 grid
						in the draw() function. When drawing a shape, color,
						opacity, size, and position are calculated using stored
						X and Y coordinates and some small amounts of
						randomization. The squares are a little more complicated
						than the circles, in that each vertex is randomly
						shifted in some direction according to these stored X
						and Y values. I detect whenever the mouse is dragged and
						check whether the left or right button is used, and
						update the appropriate X and Y values (i.e. I change the
						circles' stored X and Y values, if the left button is
						used). Additionally, I update the corresponding sound's
						volume and play speed according to the same X and Y
						values.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I worked by myself on this project. At first, I didn't
						have any ideas of what I wanted to do aside from
						including some sort of modifiable audio. I wanted the
						visuals, whatever they were, to evoke a similar feeling
						to the accompanying audio. I think I was able to
						accomplish this, though not without some pain. One of
						the lowest points for me was getting to the start of the
						Innovate step and realizing that I didn't like anything
						about the visuals. Then, in making it look better, I
						worried it was too reminiscent of my inspirations. I
						still worry that it looks too similar, but I am happy
						with what I was able to create.
