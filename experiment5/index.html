					<p>
						For this experiment, my goal was to create a rain
						simulation using ASCII characters.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Controls</b>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						The entire canvas is divided up into a grid in which
						each tile a character is drawn according to the data
						value of that tile. The data values of every tile are
						stored in an array, which is looped through to draw the
						appropriate characters. Ripples are simple objects
						consisting of a position vector, a size, and a threshold
						value (this threshold value is used to give the ripple a
						sort of wave effect, where it initially grows in
						thickness, then decreases until it disappears). For
						every tile in the grid, all ripples are looped through
						and the tile's data value is added to according to where
						it sits in relation to the ripple's position and size.
						This is also where the threshold value is taken into
						account. Spots where ripples overlap are added to
						multiple times, resulting in new characters. The
						droplets are simply vector circles that can be created
						wherever the user clicks, and decrease in size until
						they disappear. Every certain number of frames, there is
						a chance the weather will change and the rain will pick
						up or slow down. When it picks up, the colors darken and
						become less saturated, and vice versa when it slows
						down.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						This experiment was very difficult at first because I
						did not have any ideas. Many days went by before I got
						the idea to do a ripple simulation, inspired by <a
							href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1098610"
						>this metaballs project</a>. The beginning of this
						process was by far the most difficult part, because I
						didn't fully understand the code of my inspiration. It
						took me a while to fully understand it and learn how to
						modify it to make ripples rather than circles. Figuring
						that out was the high point of this experience. After
						that, it was a lot of fun to experiment with and evolve
						the concept.
