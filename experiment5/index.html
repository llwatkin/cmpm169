						For this experiment, my goal was to create a rain
						simulation using ASCII characters.<br>

						This experiment was very difficult at first because I
						did not have any ideas. It took me several days before I
						got the inspiration and idea to do a ripple simulation.
						The beginning of this process was by far the most
						difficult part, because I didnâ€™t fully understand the
						code of my inspiration, so it took me a while to figure
						out how to modify it to make ripples rather than
						circles. Figuring that out was the high point of this
						experience. After that, it was a lot of fun to
						experiment with and evolve the concept.
