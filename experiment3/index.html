						<b>Put Yourself Together</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						For this experiment, my goal was to create a moving
						puzzle from live video feed.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Controls</b>
						<br>
						Mouse: click and drag puzzle pieces to move them
						around<br>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						There are two main classes: Puzzle and Piece. The Puzzle
						stores an array of pieces and an array of grid positions
						that the pieces start out in. Each piece is drawn by
						copying a portion of the input capture. Pieces store
						variables such as a boolean describing whether it is
						snapped somewhere on the grid, a goal position to lerp
						to, and a "wrongness" value (calculated by getting the
						distance between its original location and its current
						location), among others. The Puzzle class includes a
						function to sum up all of these wrongness values, which
						is then used to modify the sound of the scene and the
						frequency at which pieces break off. Whenever a piece is
						set to break off, there is a chance that the entire
						puzzle shatters, with every piece snapped to the grid
						breaking off and flying to a random location. This
						chance increases the higher the total wrongness value
						is.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						In the beginning, I had so much trouble thinking of an
						idea for this project. Even when I thought of building a
						video puzzle, I wasn't too inspired. But as I
						experimented more, I kept getting new ideas and the
						project really started to take form. One of the highs of
						the process was the moment when I accidentally made the
						puzzle very difficult to put back together. It was a
						happy accident that shaped all of my decisions after the
						fact. Although I had a lot of issues during the process,
						most of them I was able to fix quickly after some
						thinking or research online. It took a lot of time and
						work, but I think it was well worth it.
