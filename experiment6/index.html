					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						For this experiment, my goal was to visualize wealth
						inequality with a Plinko game.<br>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I had a particularly difficult time with this project
						because I didn't have a strong concept going into it. I
						wasn't exactly sure what data I wanted to visualize, or
						how my visualization would change how one experiences
						the data. So, I focused first on the mechanics of the
						visualization, then refined the concept with some
						outside help. One of the low points of this experience
						was realizing that my visualization didn't exactly suit
						the data I initially thought I would use. One of the
						high points, though, was realizing that visualizing
						wealth inequality with Plinko would not only make a lot
						of sense, but would be especially visually striking
						compared to a pie chart of the same data.
