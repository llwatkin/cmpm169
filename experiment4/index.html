					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						For this experiment, my goal was to create an
						interactive simulation inspired by the three-body
						problem.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Controls</b>
						<br>
						Mouse (right click): hold and drag to move camera<br>
						Mouse (left click): hold and drag to rotate camera<br>
						Mouse (scroll wheel): scroll up/down to zoom in/out<br>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I started out feeling overwhelmed by the difficulty of
						creating a physics simulation. It definitely was
						difficult, and there were times where I wanted to give
						up and try some other idea. I had to accept that my
						simulation was not going to be all that accurate.
						Ultimately, the visual and auditory experience was more
						important. One of the highs of this process was finally
						getting something reminiscent of the three-body problem
						working. It was so mesmerizing to see the spheres
						interact with each other. After hours of frustration, it
						made it seem all worth it. In the end, I'm happy with
						what I managed to put together.
